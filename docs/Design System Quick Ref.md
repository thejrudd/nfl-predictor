# Design System Quick Ref — "Broadcast Editorial"

Full token table and dark-mode values: **`docs/Design Tokens.md`**

## Key Rules

- All colors via CSS custom properties in `src/index.css` — never hardcoded Tailwind palette or hex values in components. The `.dark` class on `<html>` swaps all values.
- `--color-signature` (`#F5B700`) is decorative only — never body text. Use `--color-signature-fg` for text ON signature backgrounds.
- `font-size: 16px` on all inputs (prevents iOS auto-zoom)
- Safe area insets: `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` on fixed bottom bars
- Motion: spring-curve easing `cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1)`
- Important user-facing content must fit without truncation. Names, dates, venues, stats, scores, labels, and controls should wrap, reflow, resize, or drop lower-priority chrome before using ellipsis. Ellipsis is only acceptable for nonessential decorative metadata.
- Roster player names are priority content: do not truncate or ellipsize them. Let names wrap when needed, and drop lower-priority row chrome before hiding identity text.
- Horizontal scroll cues must cover the same rendered width as the scroll rail they describe. For full-bleed mobile tab rails, wrap the cue around the full-bleed shell, not an inset parent, so tab text cannot peek through beside the arrow. Add or preserve Playwright geometry checks that compare the cue edge to the rail's actual rendered edge.

## Team Color Palettes

- NFL teams — raw palettes live in `src/data/teamColors.js` (`TEAM_COLORS`, `getTeamPalette`); computed gradients, overlays, region-aware contrast, tints, reversed-gradient exceptions, side-sensitive logo contrast, and logo badge colors live in `src/utils/teamVisualTheme.js` (`getTeamVisualTheme`). `nyg` and `nyj` are side-sensitive: left-logo Statistics cards reverse them, while right-logo Trade rows/cards keep the default direction. Used for Statistics, Companion, Trade, Scout Results pick rows, and the Compare/Heatmap surfaces.
- College teams — `src/data/collegeColors.js` (`COLLEGE_COLORS`, `getCollegePalette`, `buildCollegeRowGradient`, `getCollegeForeground`). Used for the optional Scout Prospects "Team Colors" toggle. Mirrors the NFL palette structure (primary / secondary / darkPrimary / darkSecondary) and the same `linear-gradient(135deg, primary 0%, darken(primary,0.28) 58%, secondary 100%)` row treatment used by Scout Results.
- When adding a new school to `ROOKIES_2026`, add a matching entry to `COLLEGE_COLORS` keyed by the normalized college name (`normalizeCollegeKey`). If the official primary is near-black or very dark navy, set `darkPrimary` to the brighter accent so the gradient still reads in dark mode.

## Companion And Trade Row Rendering

See [[Companion Shared Rows]] before changing Companion/Trade-adjacent selector rows.

- `CompanionPlayerRow`, `CompanionAssetRow`, and `CompanionSelectorControls` are the single source of truth for player rows, asset rows, selector rails, buttons, segmented controls, and search fields.
- Scrollable selector/tab rails should use the shared horizontal cue pattern (`useHorizontalScrollCue` + `HorizontalScrollCue`). The cue container must match the rail's visual bleed width, especially on mobile.
- `teamVisualTheme.js` owns NFL team gradients, overlays, tints, reversed-gradient exceptions, side-sensitive logo options, and contrast variables. Feature components should not create duplicate luminance/darken/team-palette helpers.
- `companionAssetVisuals.js` owns shared player images, fallback initials, team logos, position colors, and asset visual decisions.
- Player status badges, `ROSTERED` labels, trend labels, and metric text on team gradients must use the shared local-contrast path (`PlayerStatusBadge`, `CompanionPlayerStatus`, `CompanionPlayerLocalContrastText`, or `CompanionPlayerMetric`). Do not hardcode text colors based only on light/dark mode or team accent.
- Preserve row slots. Failed headshots should fall back to initials and failed logos should leave a spacer; never remove a grid cell with `display: none` because it can collapse player identity columns.
