## Design System — "Broadcast Editorial"

This system is fully implemented in main. All colors via CSS custom properties — never hardcoded Tailwind palette or hex values in components.

### Color Tokens
All defined as CSS custom properties in `src/index.css`. The `.dark` class on `<html>` swaps all values.

| Token | Light | Dark |
|---|---|---|
| `--color-bg` | `#F2F1EC` (warm off-white) | `#0C0F14` (deep slate-charcoal) |
| `--color-bg-secondary` | `#FFFFFF` | `#141A22` |
| `--color-bg-tertiary` | `#E9E8E2` | `#1C2332` |
| `--color-label` | `rgba(12,15,20,1)` | `rgba(228,235,244,1)` |
| `--color-label-secondary` | `rgba(12,15,20,0.58)` | `rgba(228,235,244,0.58)` |
| `--color-label-tertiary` | `rgba(12,15,20,0.35)` | `rgba(228,235,244,0.35)` |
| `--color-label-quaternary` | `rgba(12,15,20,0.20)` | `rgba(228,235,244,0.20)` |
| `--color-fill` | `rgba(12,15,20,0.07)` | `rgba(228,235,244,0.09)` |
| `--color-fill-secondary` | `rgba(12,15,20,0.05)` | `rgba(228,235,244,0.06)` |
| `--color-fill-tertiary` | `rgba(12,15,20,0.03)` | `rgba(228,235,244,0.04)` |
| `--color-separator` | `rgba(12,15,20,0.12)` | `rgba(228,235,244,0.10)` |
| `--color-separator-opaque` | `#D0CFC8` | `#252E3C` |
| `--color-accent` | `#1A6EFF` | `#5AADFF` |
| `--color-accent-green` | `#00A844` | `#2ED578` |
| `--color-accent-red` | `#E0270F` | `#FF4433` |
| `--color-accent-orange` | `#E07800` | `#FF8C1A` |
| `--color-signature` | `#F5B700` | `#F5B700` (same both modes) |
| `--color-signature-fg` | `#0C0F14` | `#0C0F14` (same both modes) |
| `--bar-bg` | `rgba(242,241,236,0.88)` | `rgba(12,15,20,0.90)` |
| `--bar-border` | `rgba(12,15,20,0.12)` | `rgba(228,235,244,0.10)` |
| `--bar-height-nav` | `44px` | — |
| `--bar-height-tab` | `49px` | — |

### Signature Accent Usage (`#F5B700` / `--color-signature`)
Decorative only: sidebar active border, season tab underline, progress bar fill, filter chip bg, bottom tab bar active icon/label. Never use as body text color. Text/icons placed ON a signature background use `--color-signature-fg` (`#0C0F14`).

### Key Conventions
- `font-size: 16px` on all inputs (prevents iOS auto-zoom)
- Safe area insets: `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` on fixed bottom bars
- Motion: CSS animations, spring-curve easing `cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1)`

---

## Navigation Architecture

### Layout Breakpoints
- `< 1024px` (lg): Mobile/tablet — bottom tab bar + sticky NavBar (44px)
- `≥ 1024px` (lg+): Desktop — left sidebar (240px) + full-width content area

### Sidebar / Tab Bar Visibility Pattern
```css
.app-sidebar { display: none; }
@media (min-width: 1024px) { .app-sidebar { display: flex; } }
/* Bottom tab bar / NavBar: inverse of above */
```

### State Variables
- `activeTab`: `'predictions'` | `'statistics'` | `'companion'` | `'compare'`
- `seasonView`: `'predictions'` | `'standings'` | `'playoffs'`
- `companionView`: `'roster'` | `'rankings'` | `'matchup'` | `'waiver'` | `'league'` | `'defense'` | `'trade'` | `'scoring'`

### Key Layout Files
- `src/App.jsx` — Two-panel shell
- `src/components/Sidebar.jsx` — 240px persistent desktop sidebar (lg+): brand, progress, nav, actions, version string
- `src/components/NavBar.jsx` — 44px sticky top nav (mobile/tablet only)
- `src/components/BottomTabBar.jsx` — Bottom tab bar (mobile/tablet, hidden lg+)

## Commit & Version Workflow

### Never auto-commit
Do NOT create commits, bump versions, or update any of the 6 tracked files unless the user explicitly asks. Mentioning a version number (e.g. "let's work on v5.9") means that's the version context — not a commit instruction. Only commit when the user says something like "commit this", "make a commit", or "bump the version".

**Why:** Auto-committing causes version creep and races ahead of planned roadmap milestones.

### 6-File Commit Checklist
On every commit that bumps the version, update ALL of these before committing:

1. **`CHANGELOG.md`** — Add a new version section with bullet points for all changes. New entries at the **bottom** (oldest first, newest last).
2. **`KNOWN_BUGS.md`** — Move fixed bugs from Open → Fixed with the correct version number; add any new bugs.
3. **`TO_DO.md`** — Remove completed items (see TO_DO workflow below).
4. **`package.json`** — Bump `"version"` to the new version number.
5. **`src/components/Sidebar.jsx`** — Update the hardcoded version string in the sidebar footer.
6. **`README.md`** — See README rules below.

After committing: do NOT run `git push` — the user pushes manually.

**Why package.json matters:** The version bump forces vite-plugin-pwa to regenerate the service worker precache manifest with a new revision hash, so browsers/PWA installs fetch the updated build instead of serving stale cache.

### CHANGELOG.md Rules
- Never use "Unreleased" as a section header — always assign changes to a specific version number, even if not yet released.
- If the version number is unclear, ask the user before writing the entry.

### README.md Rules
- **Features section**: Major features only, one line each. Update when a new major feature ships. No bug fixes or minor polish.
- **What's New section**: Contains ONLY the most recently committed version. Replace the previous entry entirely — do not accumulate multiple "What's New" sections. Link to CHANGELOG.md for history.
- **Roadmap section**: Derived from TO_DO.md, but only major planned versions and significant blocked features. No backlog polish or unversioned experiments.

---

## Bug Tracking (KNOWN_BUGS.md)

- When a bug is identified (whether reported or found during work): add it to the **Open** section immediately, before fixing it.
- If the bug was previously in **Fixed**: move it back to Open and remove the "Fixed In" version note.
- Move a bug to **Fixed** at commit time, using the version number being committed. Never use "Unreleased".

---

## TO_DO.md Workflow

- File is `TO_DO.md` at project root (not `to-do list.md` or any other name).
- Versioned sections are **chronological — earliest version first**, latest version last.
- **Backlog (Unversioned)** section is always at the bottom.
- Whenever a new feature is requested or planned, add it to TO_DO.md in the appropriate version section or backlog immediately.
- Completed versions are **deleted entirely** from TO_DO.md — no strikethroughs, no "✓ Complete" stubs. They live in CHANGELOG.md.
- Before every commit: cross-check TO_DO.md against CHANGELOG.md, remove everything that has been shipped. The earliest entry in TO_DO.md should always be the next unshipped version.

---

## Modal Pattern

All modals must be center-aligned. Never bottom-sheet style unless it's a deliberate ActionSheet.

- **Backdrop**: `fixed inset-0 z-50 flex items-center justify-center` with `background: rgba(0,0,0,0.5)`
- **Container**: `rounded-2xl` (not `rounded-t-2xl`), `w-full mx-4`, `maxWidth` as needed
- **Body scroll lock**: `document.body.style.overflow = 'hidden'` on mount; cleanup with `return () => { document.body.style.overflow = ''; }`
- Scrollable content goes in the **inner** content div (`overflow-y-auto`), not the outer container
- Close on backdrop click (`onClick={onClose}`); stop propagation on inner div

---

## Guide Content Style

Keep Guide content succinct, instructional, and not verbose.
- 1–2 sentences per step max
- Lead with what the feature does, follow with how to use it
- Skip background explanation; don't restate what the UI already shows
- 2–4 steps per tab is the right range

## Communication Preference

- Prefer plain-language labels over niche or non-standardized acronyms in UI copy.
- Avoid acronyms when they speed up communication at the expense of understanding.

## Scoring Call Sites

When making any change to scoring logic (new fields in `DEFAULT_SCORING`/`STAT_TO_SCORING_KEY`, position bonuses, new Sleeper stat keys), audit every location in this checklist:

### Core Engine (update first)
| File | What to check |
|---|---|
| `src/utils/scoringEngine.js` — `DEFAULT_SCORING` | Add new scoring field with `0.0` default |
| `src/utils/scoringEngine.js` — `STAT_TO_SCORING_KEY` | Map Sleeper weekly stat key → scoring key; add alias keys for variants |
| `src/utils/scoringEngine.js` — `SCORING_SETTINGS_ALIASES` | Map Sleeper `scoring_settings` key → internal key when they differ |
| `src/utils/scoringEngine.js` — `calcPoints` position block | Add position-specific bonus handling |
| `src/context/SleeperContext.jsx` | Verify startup re-derives from `league.scoring_settings` via `importLeagueScoring` |

### Projection / Analytics Engine (pass `position` everywhere)
| File | Function | What to check |
|---|---|---|
| `src/utils/projectionEngine.js` | `getDefenseStrength` | Both `calcPoints` calls must pass `player.position` |
| `src/utils/projectionEngine.js` | `getLeagueAvgPPG` | `calcPoints` call must pass `player.position` |
| `src/utils/projectionEngine.js` | `projectPlayer` | All three `calcPoints` calls must pass `pos` |
| `src/utils/projectionEngine.js` | `buildDefenseTable` | Default `valueFn` uses `(wEntry, position)` — verify new calls also pass position |
| `src/utils/projectionEngine.js` | `computePositionalRanks` | `calcPoints` must pass `p.position` |
| `src/utils/projectionEngine.js` | `getAvgPPG` | Verify signature passes position through to `calcPoints` |

### Companion Tab Components
| File | What to check |
|---|---|
| `src/components/companion/CompanionRoster.jsx` | `calcPointsFromTotals` and `getAvgPPG` — both pass `p.position` |
| `src/components/companion/CompanionLeague.jsx` | `calcPointsFromTotals` and `getAvgPPG` — both pass `p.position` |
| `src/components/companion/CompanionRankings.jsx` | `calcPointsFromTotals` — passes `p.position` |
| `src/components/companion/CompanionWaiver.jsx` | `calcPointsFromTotals`, `getRecentAvg`, inline `calcPoints` — all pass `pos` |
| `src/components/companion/CompanionMatchup.jsx` | `calcPoints` in weekly ranks loop and `enrichPlayer` — both pass `p.position`; `getAvgPPG` passes `p.position` |
| `src/components/companion/CompanionDefense.jsx` | `defenseScoredTable` getValue callback `(wEntry, pos)` — called as `getValue(wEntry, player.position)` |
| `src/components/companion/PlayerWeeklySheet.jsx` | `calcPoints` — passes `player?.position` |
| `src/components/companion/CompanionScoring.jsx` | `STAT_GROUPS` — add any new scoring field so it's visible in UI |
| `src/components/companion/CompanionTrade.jsx` — `ValuationInfoSheet` | Read new scoring settings fields; add `AdjustmentRow` entries; update KTC baseline list |

### Compare Tab Components
| File | What to check |
|---|---|
| `src/components/compare/CompareFantasyPanel.jsx` | `calcPointsFromTotals`, `getAvgPPG`, `getRecentAvg`, weekly `calcPoints` — all pass `pos` |
| `src/components/compare/CompareTradePanel.jsx` | `calcPointsFromTotals` — passes `position` in all 3 call sites |

### KTC Value Adjustments
| File | What to check |
|---|---|
| `src/utils/ktcApi.js` — `computeKtcMultipliers` | Add multiplier logic for any new scoring field that materially affects positional value |

**Before closing any scoring-related change:** grep for `calcPoints(` and `calcPointsFromTotals(` across the repo and verify every call site either (a) passes position or (b) is in a context where position is genuinely unavailable.

## Common Gotchas

### Trade proposal card sizing
Any time proposal player or draft cards are resized, also verify vertical content fit on desktop. Larger or narrower cards must still allow the stat sections to expand the card height instead of clipping or overflowing, and equal-height syncing across a trade package must continue to hold after the size change.

### Ranked lists with search filters
Always compute rank (`i + 1`) on the full sorted list, then filter for display. Never derive rank after filtering — the rank number will reflect position in the filtered subset, not the true overall rank. Carry `rank` as a property on each item; render uses `item.rank`, not the map index.

### `productionAdjustedValue` null propagation
The early-return guard must be `return ktcVal` (not `return ktcVal ?? 0`). Returning `0` for players with no KTC match causes `fmtKtcValue(0)` to render "0" instead of "—", since `adjVal ?? it.val` only falls back on null/undefined, not `0`.
