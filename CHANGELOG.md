---

## v4.3.1 — Polish & Bug Fixes
*2026-03-15*

- **Defense drilldown scroll lock** — Background page no longer scrolls while the drilldown panel is open.
- **Season progress bar visibility** — "Season X/32" progress bar in the sidebar is now hidden when not on the Predictions tab.
- **PWA cache bust** — `package.json` version bump forces service worker refresh so users receive the latest build automatically.

---

## v4.3.2 — Projection Footnotes
*2026-03-15*

- **Matchup factor footnotes** — Added plain-English explanations for the Matchup and Snap use projection factors in the drilldown math panel, alongside the existing Floor/Ceiling footnote.

---

## v4.3.3 — Defense Tab Layout
*2026-03-15*

- **Full-bleed table layout** — Defense grid now runs edge-to-edge on all screen sizes using negative margin technique (`-mx-4 sm:-mx-6 lg:-mx-8`), taking full advantage of available width.
- **Unified labeled filter bar** — View, Position, Stat, Color, and Team Colors controls are now labeled and arranged in a single horizontal row on wide screens, wrapping naturally on mobile.
- **Wide-screen table expansion** — Added `width: 100%` alongside `minWidth: max-content` so the table fills available space on wide screens instead of leaving dead space.

---

## v4.3.4 — Defense Grid Bug Fixes
*2026-03-16*

- **Frozen header row** — Header row now sticks to the top of the table viewport as you scroll down. Root cause: `overflow-x: auto` implicitly forces `overflow-y: auto` per CSS spec; without a defined height, sticky `top: 0` never triggered. Fixed by adding `maxHeight` + `overflowY: auto` to the container.
- **Opaque sticky first column** — Team column background is now a solid blended color (`blendColor()`) instead of semi-transparent `rgba`, so scrolled heatmap cells no longer bleed through.
- **Independent scroll on mobile** — Table now scrolls independently from the page on all screen sizes.
- **BYE week labels** — Bye weeks are now labeled "BYE" in the grid instead of showing blank cells. Applies to both Allowed and Scored views.

---

## v4.3.5 — Bye Week Fixes + Roster Drilldown OPP Column
*2026-03-16*

- **Defense Scored — bye week filter** — `defenseScoredTable` now filters entries through `scheduleMap`, removing phantom bye-week stats that Sleeper occasionally records for weeks a team didn't play.
- **Matchup — BYE WEEK badge** — When a starter's team has no game scheduled for the current week, their matchup card now shows a "BYE WEEK" badge instead of a blank opponent line.
- **Roster drilldown — OPP column** — Player weekly sheet now includes an opponent column showing the opponent abbreviation (e.g. `KC`, `BUF`) for each played week, sourced from the stat entry or ESPN schedule.
- **Roster drilldown — BYE rows** — Bye weeks now appear as a dedicated "BYE" row in the weekly sheet instead of being silently omitted. DNP rows (game played, no stats logged) are also preserved.

---

## v4.3.6 — Defense Grid Visual Fixes
*2026-03-16*

- **WAS/LAR team colors** — Washington and LA Rams rows now show correct team colors. STADIUMS uses `WAS`/`LAR` while TEAM_COLORS uses `wsh`/`la`; added `TEAM_COLOR_KEY` alias map to bridge the mismatch.
- **Opaque header row** — Header row background changed from `--color-fill-secondary` (~5% opacity) to `--color-bg` (fully opaque), so the header stays readable when scrolling.
- **Opaque sticky column borders** — Borders on the frozen Team column and corner cell now use `--color-separator-opaque` (solid color) instead of the semi-transparent `--color-separator`, eliminating the bleedthrough gap visible between rows when scrolling horizontally.
- **Responsive table height** — Added `--defense-grid-max-height` CSS variable with breakpoints: `100dvh - 260px` on mobile, `100dvh - 160px` on desktop (lg+), giving the grid significantly more vertical space on larger screens.

---

## v4.3.7 — Defense Grid Rendering Fixes
*2026-03-16*

- **Sticky column/header borders** — Fixed the frozen Team column and header row visually bleeding scrolled content through their borders. Root cause: `borderCollapse: 'collapse'` shares borders between sticky and non-sticky cells; browsers render shared borders on the wrong compositing layer during scroll. Fixed by switching to `borderCollapse: 'separate'` + `borderSpacing: 0` and replacing sticky cell borders with `box-shadow`, which always renders in the element's own stacking context above scrolled content.
- **Team color opacity in light mode** — Row team color tints in the Defense grid were too washed out in light mode. Increased blend alpha from 0.75 → 0.90 for a richer, more readable tint.
- **Team name contrast** — Defense grid team name text now uses WCAG-luminance-aware contrast color (`#111` or `#fff`) based on the blended background, ensuring readability against any team color in both light and dark mode.

## v4.4 — Defense Grid Team Attribution Fix
*2026-03-17*

**Problem:** The Defense Matrix grid and drilldown incorrectly attributed stats for any player who was traded or signed after the season ended. Sleeper's bulk stats endpoint (`/stats/nfl/regular/{season}/{week}`) returns raw stats only — no team, opponent, or game metadata. The only available signal was `player.team` from Sleeper's players DB, which always reflects the player's *current* roster, not the team they played for during the season. For example, Justin Fields (traded to KC after the 2025 season) had all his NYJ stats attributed to KC's opponents, corrupting the defensive rankings for multiple teams.

**Solution — three-layer ESPN cross-reference:**

- **Pass 1: ESPN eventlog enhancement** — ESPN's per-athlete eventlog endpoint returns a `statistics.$ref` URL per game that embeds the ESPN competitor ID (franchise ID). This ID is baked into the game record at game time and never changes on a trade. The `fetchSeasonSchedule` call now also captures ESPN event IDs and competitor IDs from the scoreboard, enabling a cross-reference: for each offensive player (QB/RB/WR/TE/K) with an `espn_id`, one eventlog fetch resolves every game to a confirmed `{ team, opp }` pair, merged into the weekly stat entry as `wEntry.team`, `wEntry.opp`, and `wEntry._teamSource = 'espn'`.
- **Pass 2: ESPN roster name-match for null-espn_id players** — Nearly two-thirds of offensive players in Sleeper's DB have `espn_id: null`, excluding them from Pass 1. A second pass fetches each team's ESPN roster, matches players by normalized name (stripping periods, suffixes like Jr/II/III), resolves the missing ESPN athlete ID, then runs the same eventlog pipeline. This resolved ~511 of 531 affected players.
- **Inferred season team fallback** — For partially-resolved players (some weeks enhanced, others not), `buildDefenseTable` and the drilldown filter now infer the player's historical season team from their other ESPN-enhanced weeks rather than falling back to `player.team`.
- **est. badge** — The drilldown displays an **est.** badge with a tooltip on any player whose team attribution is using the `player.team` fallback, so users can identify potentially misattributed entries at a glance.
- **WAS/JAX abbreviation aliases** — Added `WAS: 'wsh'` and `JAX: 'jax'` to `TEAM_ESPN_ID` to bridge Sleeper ↔ ESPN team abbreviation mismatches that caused roster lookups to fail for Washington (20 players) and Jacksonville.

## v4.4.1 — Defense Grid Polish
*2026-03-17*

- **Defense Scored drilldown attribution fix** — Applied the same inferred-season-team fallback from v4.4 to the Scored (defensive player) drilldown. Previously, IDP players (DL/LB/DB) in the Scored drilldown used `player.team` directly instead of ESPN-confirmed game-time team data, causing the same misattribution bug for traded defensive players. The fix uses `wEntry.team` (ESPN-confirmed) first, falls back to other enhanced weeks in the same season, then `player.team`. The **est.** badge now also appears in the Scored drilldown for unverified entries.
- **Player name navigation** — Player names in the Defense grid drilldown are now clickable for all players, including those whose `espn_id` is null in Sleeper's DB. Pass 2 resolved ESPN IDs are now stored in a `espnIdOverrides` context map and used as a fallback for navigation.
- **Contextual back navigation** — When navigating from the Defense grid drilldown to a player's Statistics page, the back button now reads **"← Defense"** and returns to the Defense grid. In all other cases the button continues to read **"← Statistics"** and returns to the statistics browser.
- **Home/away in drilldown header** — The drilldown matchup header now uses `@` notation (standard NFL: AWAY @ HOME) instead of `vs` when home/away data is available from the scheduleMap. Falls back to `vs` when home/away is unknown.
- **Roadmap file renamed** — `to-do list.md` renamed to `TO_DO.md`; restructured to chronological version order with backlog at the bottom.

---

## v4.5 — Heatmap Refresh
*2026-03-17*

- **Renamed "Defense" tab to "Heatmap"** — Companion sub-navigation label updated across the app, including the back-navigation label from the Statistics page.
- **Phase filter** — The "View: Allowed / Scored" toggle is now "Phase: Offense / Defense" for clearer terminology.
- **Filter bar reordered** — New order: Stat → Phase → Position → Color → Location.
- **Home/Away location filter** — New Location filter (All / Home / Away) on the Heatmap. Filters both the cell values and the AVG column denominator to only include games matching the selection. Filtered-out weeks show a dimmed dash and are not drillable.
- **Companion sub-nav overflow fix** — Tabs (Roster, Rankings, Matchup, etc.) now scroll horizontally within the nav strip on mobile instead of overflowing the page and causing erroneous horizontal scrolling.
- **Scoring badge removed from Roster** — The league scoring summary badge has been removed from the Roster screen. Scoring details are available in the dedicated Scoring tab.

---

## v4.5.1 — Heatmap Mobile Fixes
*2026-03-17*

- **Sub-nav vertical scroll fix** — Companion sub-navigation tab strip no longer scrolls vertically in addition to horizontally on mobile.
- **Heatmap bottom inset fix** — Heatmap grid on mobile PWA now scrolls fully to the bottom row. The bottom tab bar / safe-area inset was obscuring the last rows, requiring whole-page scrolling that broke navigation.

---

## v4.6 — Heatmap Continued
*2026-03-19*

- **Spread stat mode** — New "Spread" option in the Stat filter. Cells show each team's spread for that week (e.g. `-3.0`, `+7.5`), colored green (covered) or red (didn't cover). Requires the bundled `odds.js` data (generated from nflverse historical odds).
- **Score stat mode drilldown** — Tapping a cell in Score mode opens a full box score for that game (final score, passing/rushing/receiving leaders for both teams) instead of the standard player drilldown.
- **Spread mode drilldown** — Tapping a cell in Spread mode opens the same box score layout. The game header shows each team's spread and O/U line directly under the matchup; covered results are green, didn't cover is red; Over/Under result is shown without color.
- **Color filter hidden in Spread mode** — The Color filter is hidden when Spread is selected (it has no meaning for cover/no-cover coloring), except the team colors toggle remains visible when a favorite team is set.
- **"Covers" column header** — The AVG column header changes to "Covers" when viewing Spread mode, reflecting the win-loss cover record shown.
- **Renamed filters** — "Vegas Odds" → "Spread", "Game Score" → "Score".
- **Player data cache auto-clear on version bump** — The `nfl_pc_*` localStorage cache is now automatically cleared when the app version changes, preventing stale player data (wrong team attribution, missing ESPN IDs) from persisting across deploys.
- **Phase filter hidden for offense-only modes** — The Phase (Offense/Defense) filter is no longer shown when Rec Yds, Rush Yds, Score, or Spread is selected — those modes are offense-only.
- **Home/Away filter respected in week sort** — Filtered cells now correctly show a faded dash (instead of live color/value) when the week sort is active and the game doesn't match the location filter.
- **Desktop heatmap height fix** — Grid now fills available vertical space on desktop. The tab bar height (49px) was incorrectly subtracted even though the tab bar is hidden at lg+.
- **Heatmap → Statistics year range fix** — Player links from the heatmap now open the correct full career year range. `playerMeta.experience` was absent, causing the year list to default to current year only.
- **Heatmap initial render fix** — Heatmap now renders immediately after Load Stats without needing to visit another Companion tab first. `loadPlayers()` is now called on mount.

---

## v4.6.1 — Score Mode Cell Fix
*2026-03-19*

- **Score mode inline display** — Heatmap cells in Score mode now show the final score as `X-X` (team score · opponent score) with both team abbreviations in small text underneath (e.g. `28-14` / `KC · DEN`), replacing the previous stacked single-number layout.
