## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20+

### Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Output is written to `dist/`.

## Docker Deployment

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

The app will be available on port 80 by default. To use a different port:

```bash
PORT=8080 docker compose up -d --build
```

Direct client routes are already configured for SPA-safe refreshes in both places that matter for `v6.2` routing:
- `nginx.conf` uses `try_files ... /index.html` for direct browser loads
- `vite-plugin-pwa` uses `navigateFallback: '/index.html'` for navigations inside the installed PWA

To validate that setup after a production build:

```bash
npm run validate:routing
```

## What's New in v7.5

- **Predictor redesign** - Predictions now center on record-first picks, an Advanced Mode team drilldown, editorial standings, and a manual playoff bracket.
- **2026 schedule data** - The app now bundles the regular-season schedule with ESPN event ids, kickoff metadata, broadcasters, venues, and ordered opponents.
- **Statistics Schedule** - Statistics includes week and team schedule views with international, PrimeTime, and holiday filters.
- **Prediction fixes** - Choose Record now blocks impossible overall/division combinations, balances division records, and propagates forced undefeated/winless picks to opponents.
- **Statistics Visual fixes** - Future empty seasons stay hidden, Visual works without a connected fantasy league, and the visual opens against the latest stat-bearing season.

For the full version history, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Roadmap

- **v8.0 - ESPN League Integration** - Planned major integration track.
- **v9.0 - Live Fantasy Scoring** - Planned live scoring track.
- **Scout Rookie Projection Layer** - Add next-season rookie projections that work for standard and IDP-focused draft prep without overloading the current Scout board.
- **Trade follow-through** - Continue polishing Trade drilldowns, remaining explanation copy, and proposal-card readability after the v7.3 module split.
