## What's New in v4.3.1

- **Defense drilldown scroll lock** — Background page no longer scrolls while the drilldown panel is open
- **Season progress bar** — "Season X/32" progress bar in the sidebar is now hidden when not on the Predictions tab
- **PWA cache bust** — `package.json` version bumped to force service worker refresh so users receive the latest build automatically

## What's New in v4.3

### Defense Matrix — Enhancements
- **Team Colors & Logos** — Each team row in the grid is tinted with its official primary color and shows its ESPN logo for faster visual scanning
- **Opponent Labels** — Each cell shows the opponent abbreviation in small text below the value
- **Game Score Mode** — New "Game Score" stat filter in Allowed view shows the actual NFL score for each game (pulled from ESPN schedule data)
- **Scored View Stat Filters** — Defense Scored view now has 8 stat filters: Fantasy Pts, Sacks, INT, Forced Fumbles, TFL, Passes Defended, QB Hits, Defensive TDs
- **View Labels** — "Offense Allowed" → "Allowed", "Defense Scored" → "Scored"
- **Team Color Heatmap Toggle** — Optional toggle (when a favorite team is set) to use team colors instead of the default red–green heatmap palette
- **Conference/Division Labels** — Team cells show a conference or division sub-label when sorting by those modes
- **Drilldown Redesign** — Compact one-line player rows (name · pos · value); header shows "Week N — Away @ Home" with team logos; player names link directly to their Statistics profile page
- **Bug Fixes** — Average calculation now divides by games played (not weeks with data); Conference sort no longer falls through to Division sort

### Matchup — Enhancements
- **5-Level Matchup Difficulty** — Replaced the 3-level ±10% threshold system with a percentile-based ranking across all 32 teams. Levels: Difficult / Challenging / Average / Favorable / Easy. Requires ≥ 3 games of data per team and ≥ 5 teams with data; does not apply to IDP/defensive players
- **Score Range Coloring** — Post-game final score is now color-coded by where it lands relative to the projected range: red (below range), orange (bottom 30%), white (middle 40%), light green (top 30%), green (above range). Replaces the +/- diff badge
- **Roster Slot Labels** — Center badge now shows the actual roster slot (FLEX, SF, IDP, FLX, DST, etc.) from the league's `roster_positions` instead of the player's raw position
- **Home/Away Fix** — Matchup screen was incorrectly showing all players as Away; fixed by preferring ESPN schedule data over Sleeper's unreliable `home` field
- **Season Picker** — Header now derives available seasons from `league.season` and `previous_league_id`; hidden entirely for first-year leagues. Removed the confusing "N players" stat count

### Other
- **Statistics Deep-Link Fix** — Clicking a player name in the Defense drilldown now correctly routes to their ESPN stats page (was using Sleeper player IDs instead of ESPN IDs)
- **Guide Updates** — Companion guide rewritten to accurately describe the projection formula, floor/ceiling calculation, and all Defense tab features

## What's New in v4.2

- **Defense Matrix** — New Companion tab showing all 32 teams' fantasy points allowed (Offense Allowed) or scored (Defense Scored) per position per week in a scrollable heat-mapped table
- **Heatmap** — Multi-stop red→orange→yellow→green color spectrum; three scope options (Overall, By Week, By Team) each with independent scales; AVG column has its own scale
- **Drilldown** — Tap any cell to see the per-player stat breakdown with signed point contributions for that matchup
- **Position & Stat Filters** — Offense mode: All/QB/RB/WR/TE/K + Fantasy Pts/Rec Yds/Rush Yds; Defense mode: All/DL/LB/DB
- **Column Sorting** — Click any column header to sort; Team column has A–Z, Conference, and Division sub-sorts
- **QB Opp Fix** — Fetches per-QB Sleeper stats to get game-time `opp` field (bulk stats endpoint never includes it), resolving under-counted defensive game totals for QBs who changed teams in the offseason
- **Beta Badge** — Companion tab marked Beta in sidebar and bottom tab bar

## What's New in v4.1

- **Matchup Difficulty Badge** — Easy / Avg / Hard badge per player based on defensive points allowed to that position vs league average (requires 3+ games of data)
- **Redesigned Matchup Player Card** — Cleaner three-line layout: name + team, scored / projected range, vs OPP + location + badge
- **Enhanced Player Drilldown** — Rankings (week rank, season rank, avg PPG) and Game Context sections above the stat breakdown
- **Snap % Projection Factor** — Recent snap usage (last 4 games) vs season average as a fourth projection multiplier
- **Companion Guide** — Full guide content for the Companion tab

## What's New in v4.0

- **Sleeper Integration** — Connect via Sleeper username, select a league, sync scoring settings
- **Companion Tab** — Fantasy tools: Connect, Roster, Matchup, Waiver, and Scoring views
- **Fantasy Matchup** — Side-by-side starter comparison with full scoring breakdowns
- **Positional Rankings** — Week and season rank per player in the matchup view
- **Projections** — Min/max/projected ranges factoring opponent strength, home/away, weather, and snap trend
- **Custom Scoring Engine** — PPR / Half-PPR / Standard with per-stat multipliers; imports from Sleeper league

## Roadmap

**v4.5** — Week-by-week schedule view *(blocked on 2026 season schedule data)*
