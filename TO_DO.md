## Planned Versions

### v7.0.5 - Post-Draft nflverse Enrichment

After the draft concludes, build `scripts/scout-nflverse-update.mjs` to fetch  
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leesharpe/nfldata/master/data/draft_picks.csv`,  
normalize player names, match against `src/data/rookies.js`, and output a JSON patch  
with verified `draftRound`, `draftPick`, `draftOverall`, `draftTeam`, and `draftTeamName`  
ready to paste into `rookies.js`. Mirrors the existing `scout-espn-ids.mjs` pattern.

Fields available from nflverse: `season`, `team`, `round`, `pick` (overall), `pfr_name`,  
`category` (QB/RB/WR/TE/OL/DL/LB/DB), `position` (specific). CORS-safe browser fetch  
from `raw.githubusercontent.com`.

### v7.1 - Trade Module Decomposition

Split the monolithic `CompanionTrade.jsx` (4,800+ lines) and `opportunityEngine.js` (3,000+ lines) into focused, single-responsibility modules to reduce per-edit token cost and improve maintainability.

- **CompanionTrade split** — Extract into logical sub-files: TradeProposalBuilder (main component state & handlers), ProposalPlayerCard, TradeProposalPanel (list + filters), UpgradeFinderPage, ValuationInfoSheet, RosterBrowseModal
- **opportunityEngine split** — Separate into: rosterAnalysis (lineup solver, benchmarks), proposalBuilder (need-driven & surplus pipelines), upgradePackaging (package scoring, candidate selection), opportunityCards (top-level assembly & exports)
- **Shared types/constants extraction** — Move position colors, slot eligibility maps, and formatting helpers into a shared trade constants file

### v7.2 - Statistics / Fantasy Drilldown Unification

Unifies player detail analysis so fantasy scoring and regular game production live in one place, with a consistent drilldown model across Statistics and Companion.

- **Mode toggle on Statistics player pages** - Add a persistent, clearly active toggle that switches the player view between `Fantasy` and `Game Stats` without leaving the page
- **Real-time stat model swap** - Recompute displayed values, labels, summaries, and weekly breakdown rows live when the mode changes so fantasy scoring and raw production stay in the same layout
- **Shared drilldown destination** - Route all Companion player drill-ins to the Statistics page instead of opening tab-specific player modals, so every Companion path uses one canonical player-analysis destination
- **Modal retirement for Companion player drilldowns** - Remove the mixed drilldown model where some Companion tabs open player modals and others deep-link into Statistics; the unified behavior should always be a Statistics-page handoff with preserved back context
- **Consistent detail hierarchy** - Redesign the Statistics player page so matchup context, weekly tables, summary blocks, and fantasy/game-stat views can absorb the detail currently split across Companion-specific modal flows
- **Mode-state clarity** - Add explicit visual indication of the active mode and ensure navigation/back behavior preserves the selected player context when arriving from Companion
- **Fix & Improve toggles in Player view in Statistics** - Introduce consistent desigh philosophy throughout the app for any available toggles. Allow "Fantasy Scoring" toggle to to flip all statistics to their respective fantasy value. Improve layout so all relevant stats are shown relative to position on desktop, and are removed in reverse order of importance to accommodate limited screen space on smaller devices.

### v7.3 - Scout Rookie Projection Layer

Tabled Scout enhancements that build on the post-draft rookie data foundation without expanding v7.0 scope.

- **Next-season fantasy projection layer for rookies** - Add a fantasy-facing projection surface for the upcoming NFL season so Scout can serve both standard rookie boards and IDP-aware formats without overloading the current prospect filters. Scope should cover offensive and IDP leagues, projection source-of-truth, display hierarchy, and how projections interact with draft status and college production.

### v8.0 - ESPN League Integration
### v9.0 - Live Fantasy Scoring

## Optimizations

- **Shell visual refinement** - Targeted CSS/JSX-only polish pass on the desktop sidebar and navigation shell. Full proposal and rationale in [`docs/Shell Redesign Proposal.md`](docs/Shell%20Redesign%20Proposal.md). Five changes: (1) unify sidebar background to match canvas, (2) redesign brand wordmark, (3) strengthen active nav state to a single amber signal, (4) add visual hierarchy to the actions section, (5) replace `visibility: hidden` on the progress bar with conditional rendering to reclaim space on non-Predictions tabs.
- **Trade proposal card desktop sizing polish** - Continue refining desktop card sizing so larger cards remain crisp and readable without reintroducing vertical text overflow or awkward package wrapping on narrower desktop widths.
- **Lint modernization / cleanup pass** - Resolve the current ESLint backlog across the app so `npm run lint` passes cleanly. Prioritize the new Trade surfaces and active Companion areas first, then address broader React hook/state-effect warnings, unused vars, Fast Refresh export issues, and config globals like `__APP_VERSION__`.
- **Trade valuation path deduplication** - Consolidate roster search, roster browse, partner preview, and side-card value calculations onto a shared helper so player availability, estimated values, and additive totals stay consistent across all Trade entry points.
- **Companion tab load-time optimization** - Improve initial and first-open load times across all Companion tabs by preloading shared data more intentionally, deferring non-critical derivations, reducing duplicate calculations between tabs, and minimizing context-driven rerenders.
- **Companion Heatmap first-open performance** - Optimize initial load by reducing eager table computation, avoiding unnecessary recomputes after stat enrichment, and limiting context-driven rerenders from unrelated state like progress updates.
- **Reduce Heatmap `loadSeasonStats` fetch time** - Companion -> Heatmap now avoids blocking on pass-2 enhancement and uses a faster local offense table builder, but the next likely optimization is reducing the raw `loadSeasonStats` fetch cost. This is a different class of optimization and riskier because it touches the shared season-stats loading path.

## Backlog (Unversioned)

### Deferred / Tabled

- **League-scoped shareable links (tabled from v6.5)** - Revisit after current performance and drilldown unification priorities. Scope remains: league-aware Companion/Trade URLs, league id format decision, ownership validation, connect-flow handoff, mismatch UX, and strict shareability boundaries.
- **Shareable-link first phase (tabled from v6.3)** - Revisit page + selected-player URL sharing after the current Companion/Trade stabilization passes are complete.

### New Technologies

- **Open Pencil evaluation** - Investigate how Open Pencil's drafting, editing, and text-workflow concepts could inform future NFL Predictor writing surfaces such as player narratives, matchup writeups, trade explanations, export copy, or guided content-generation tools.
- **Pretext evaluation** - Investigate how Pretext's rich-text / structured-editor concepts could support future in-app note-taking, report building, annotation, or editorial workflows tied to Trade, Draft Coach, or Statistics drilldowns.
- **balldontlie NFL API evaluation** - Evaluate whether BALLDONTLIE NFL can power a live scoring layer for games, drives, injuries, standings, play-by-play, and betting-adjacent context, with strict rate-limit protection and a server-side key boundary before any production use.
- **Authentication / memberships architecture** - Design a self-host-friendly auth system that lets hosts control access, optionally charge memberships to cover hosting/API costs, and leaves room for a future licensing model that could support commercial hosting with royalties back to the project owner.

### Season Predictions (Unblocked When Data Available)

- **Week-by-Week View** *(blocked on 2026 schedule data)* - Browse the full schedule by week: all matchups for a given week with current predictions reflected. Navigate between weeks via prev/next controls. When the NFL releases the 2026 schedule, update the schedule data source and implement this view. Read-only at launch (reflects existing team-level picks); interactive game picking from the week view is a future enhancement.

### Fantasy Companion

- **Roster player drilldown - stat category filter** - Allow filtering weekly stats by category (Pass, Rush, Rec, Defense, All) with a position-appropriate default.
- **Start/sit recommendations** - Companion view that runs `projectPlayer()` across all rostered players and ranks them by projected output within each position group. Surfaces a clear start recommendation for each roster slot.

### Season Predictions

- **Season Narrative** - Auto-generate a text summary of your predicted season (e.g. "The Bills go 14-3 and clinch the AFC East in Week 15..."). Punted from versioned roadmap - revisit when Apple Intelligence or a viable in-browser LLM option matures.
- **Historical Comparison** - Show how your predicted record compares to each team's actual results from recent seasons. Highlight where you're more bullish or bearish than history.
- **Compare Mode** - Import a friend's exported JSON predictions and diff against yours: side-by-side records, agree/disagree highlights, biggest divergences.
- **Image Export Redesign** - Redesign as a compact ~1080x1080 shareable summary instead of a raw page screenshot.

### Player Stats Visualization

- **Weekly Performance Chart** - Per-player chart showing season-long performance week by week. X axis is each game week. The user selects a stat to visualize via position-specific toggles (QB: passing yards, completion %, rushing yards, passing TDs, interceptions, etc.; RB: rushing yards, carries, receiving yards, rush TDs, etc.; WR/TE: targets, receptions, receiving yards, receiving TDs, etc.). When a stat is selected, the chart renders two lines: one for the raw stat value (left Y axis) and one for the fantasy points that stat contributed that week (right Y axis), since their scales are incompatible. In addition, a bar is rendered for each week showing the opposing defense's performance allowed against the selected stat category, giving context for whether a production week was impressive or expected given the matchup. All stat toggles and both Y axes update together when the selection changes.

### Player Info

- **Player Info & Rosters - Expanded** - Interesting tidbits and facts, team history and records, career length (starting year), player rankings.
- **Flavor text for player cards** - Fun (and sometimes not so fun) facts about certain players, that function like flavor text on a trading card.
- **Per-team detail theming** - When opening a team detail modal, adopt that specific team's colors. Deferred from v3.0; global favorite-team theming (v3.1) covers app-wide accent.

### Analytics

- **Strength of Schedule Visualization** - Chart or ranking showing each team's predicted strength of schedule based on your picks.
- **Draft Order Projection** - Show projected draft order for non-playoff teams based on predicted records.
- **Win Probability Overlay** - Pull Vegas odds or public power rankings to show how your picks compare to consensus.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation** - 1,000 in-browser simulations using win probabilities; playoff odds as percentages. Web Worker for scale. All logic in `/utils/simEngine.ts`.
- **Playoff Leverage Index** - For each game, show the playoff probability delta between the two outcomes. Built on Monte Carlo.

### Polish

- **Collapsible desktop sidebar** - Allow the lg+ sidebar shell to collapse into a narrower icon-led state so users can reclaim more horizontal space without losing access to primary navigation.
- **Confetti / Animations** - Celebrate when all 32 teams are predicted and the season is valid.
- **Richer PWA Install UI** - Add `screenshots` to the web manifest for the enhanced Chrome install dialog. Requires desktop (1280x800) and mobile (390x844) screenshots in `public/screenshots/` referenced in `vite.config.js`. Non-blocking - basic install prompt works without this.
- **Shareable Links** - Encode predictions into a URL hash for sharing without import/export.
- **Undo/Redo** - Allow users to back out of recent changes without a full reset.
