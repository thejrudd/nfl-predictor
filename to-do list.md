# NFL Predictor — Roadmap

## Features

### Image Export Redesign
Redesign as a compact, shareable summary (~1080x1080, Instagram post size) instead of a raw page screenshot. Show all team picks in a clean grid layout rather than dumping every app view into one tall image.

### Player Info & Rosters
Add a player info section accessible from each team view, pulled client-side from a public API (e.g. ESPN, nfl.com, or sportsdata.io) to keep server load minimal. Should include:
- Player headshots
- Key stats (passing yards, TDs, tackles, etc.)
- Position and jersey number
- Notable accomplishments (Pro Bowl, All-Pro, awards)

### Compare Mode
Import a friend's exported JSON predictions and diff them against yours — highlight where you agree/disagree, show side-by-side records, and surface the biggest divergences.

## Fun / Analytics

### Season Narrative
Auto-generate a text summary of your predicted season (e.g. "The Bills go 14-3 and clinch the AFC East in Week 15..."). Could include division race storylines, upset picks, and playoff implications.

### Historical Comparison
Show how your predicted record for each team compares to their actual results from recent seasons. Highlight where you're more bullish or bearish than history.
