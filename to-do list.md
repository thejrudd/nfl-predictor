# NFL Predictor — Roadmap

## Versioned Releases

### ~~v2.3 — Search / Filter~~
~~Quick-find a team or filter by division/conference directly from the main predictions view. A search icon in the existing controls row (alongside dark mode toggle, count badge, menu button) expands an inline search/filter bar that slides in below the header between the header and the first team card. Dismissed via X button or completing a search. Zero permanent screen space cost, no interaction with the scroll/collapse system.~~ **Shipped in v2.3.**

### v2.4 — Historical Comparison
Show how your predicted record for each team compares to their actual results from recent seasons. Highlight where you're more bullish or bearish than history.

### v3.0 — Fantasy Football / Sleeper League Integration
Allow users to connect their Sleeper league and surface fantasy-relevant insights from player stat data. Should include:
- Sleeper league import (connect via Sleeper username or league ID)
- Custom scoring rule input (PPR, half-PPR, standard; passing/rushing/receiving TD values; bonus thresholds; defensive scoring; etc.)
- Per-player fantasy point totals calculated from historical and current-season stats
- Start/sit recommendations based on recent performance, matchup, and depth chart position
- Waiver wire / pickup suggestions based on available players and projected output
- Season-long projections and rankings by position under the user's scoring system

### v4.0 — Visual Overhaul
A ground-up redesign of the app's visual language and UI consistency. Goals:
- **Bottom tab bar navigation** — split the app into two distinct top-level domains: "Season" (Make Predictions, Standings, Playoff Seeding) and "Players" (Player Browser, Player Profiles, future Fantasy/Sleeper integration). Each tab has its own scroll context and sub-navigation. This is the standard pattern for mobile sports apps (ESPN, NFL app) and scales naturally as each domain grows.
- Unified design system — consistent spacing, typography scale, and color tokens across all views
- Redesigned prediction cards and team rows with richer visual hierarchy
- Improved standings and playoff bracket presentation
- Polished mobile experience with touch-optimized interactions
- Smoother transitions and micro-animations throughout
- Potential dark mode refinement or new theme options

### v4.5 — Week-by-Week View
Browse the full schedule by week — see all matchups for a given week, with current predictions reflected. Navigate between weeks via prev/next controls. **Blocked on 2026 season schedule data.** When the NFL releases the 2026 schedule, update the schedule data source and implement this view. Read-only in v4.5 (reflects existing team-level picks); interactive game picking from the week view is a future enhancement.

## Features (Unversioned)

### Season Narrative
Auto-generate a text summary of your predicted season (e.g. "The Bills go 14-3 and clinch the AFC East in Week 15..."). Could include division race storylines, upset picks, and playoff implications. Punted from versioned roadmap — revisit when Apple Intelligence or a viable in-browser LLM option matures.

### Image Export Redesign
Redesign as a compact, shareable summary (~1080x1080, Instagram post size) instead of a raw page screenshot. Show all team picks in a clean grid layout rather than dumping every app view into one tall image.

### Player Info & Rosters — Expanded
The basic player browser and profiles are live. Future expansion should include:
- Interesting tidbits and facts about the player
- Team history and historical records
- Player rankings
- Career length (starting year)

### Compare Mode
Import a friend's exported JSON predictions and diff them against yours — highlight where you agree/disagree, show side-by-side records, and surface the biggest divergences.

### Shareable Prediction Card
A dedicated `<PredictionCard />` component that renders a clean per-team card showing:
- Team name and logo
- Predicted record
- Projected seed
- Division finish

Export via canvas (`useRef` → render to canvas → `toBlob()`), avoiding HTML screenshot limitations.

### Monte Carlo Simulation (Client-Side)
Run 1,000 in-memory simulations using win probabilities derived from binary picks. Store results in a `Map` and calculate playoff odds as a percentage. Use a Web Worker if scaling above 5,000 simulations.

Architecture: all simulation logic isolated in `/utils/simEngine.ts`, triggered only when picks change (not on every re-render).

### Playoff Leverage Index
For each game, run two simulations — one with each team winning — and compare the resulting playoff probability delta. Display something like: *"This game swings playoff odds by 18%."* Built on top of the Monte Carlo simulation engine.

### Strength of Schedule Bias Slider
A global "Team Rating Bias" slider that bumps win probability by ~5–7% per unit and applies the modifier before simulation runs.

### Future Analytics (Post-Simulation)
- Weekly playoff probability graph (Recharts)
- Momentum graph per team
- Seed movement animation (Tailwind transitions)

### Community & Social

#### Shareable Links
Encode predictions into a URL hash so users can share a link instead of a file — no import/export needed, just copy and send.

#### Leaderboard / Accuracy Tracker
Once the real season starts, track how accurate each user's predictions were week by week. Compare predicted outcomes to actual results as the season unfolds.

### UX Enhancements

#### Undo/Redo
Add undo support so users can back out of recent changes without resetting everything.

### Data & Analytics

#### Strength of Schedule Visualization
A chart or ranking showing each team's predicted strength of schedule based on your picks.

#### Win Probability Overlay
Pull Vegas odds or public power rankings to show how your picks compare to consensus.

#### Draft Order Projection
Show projected draft order for non-playoff teams based on predicted records.

#### Richer PWA Install UI *(backburner)*
Add `screenshots` to the web manifest so Chrome shows the enhanced install dialog with app previews. Requires one desktop screenshot (1280×800, `form_factor: wide`) and one mobile screenshot (390×844, `form_factor: narrow`) saved to `public/screenshots/` and referenced in the `screenshots` array in `vite.config.js`. Non-blocking — basic install prompt works without this.

#### Confetti / Animations
Celebrate when all 32 teams are predicted and the season is valid.
